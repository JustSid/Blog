Hi, I'm Sidney! I'm a graphics developer at Laminar Research. I like everything related to 3d graphics and high performance and work on the graphics stack for X-Plane, a professional flight simulator made by Laminar Research. I've been developing games since I was about 12 years old, back then by mostly copying code from a Delphi book I got as a birthday gift. Nowadays I copy and paste code from Stackoverflow but I'm still just as excited as I was all these years ago.

I've worked on products that have shipped on all major platforms: Windows, Linux, macOS, iOS as well as Android. Mostly writing C++ code and working with Vulkan, Metal and OpenGL.

In my spare time I like to tinker on my i686 based kernel firedrake and my 3d Game Engine Rayne which one day may or may not see the light of day. I also have a keen interest in 3d printing and electronics, although my hardware skills are still lacking quite a bit. I'm definitely better with a keyboard than soldering iron.

Originally from Germany, but I have since lived in the UK and Canada. Happily married to a lovely Canadian.
