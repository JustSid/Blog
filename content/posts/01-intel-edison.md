Received my Intel Edison today, super cute device that promises to be quite lovely (especially for me coming from an x86 background and having a hard time with the ARM on the Raspberry Pi). I especially love the super small form factor of the Edison, which makes some applications much more feasible than the Pi.

I still want to port Firedrake to the Pi and have actually made quite a few changes to support different hardware personalities as well as CPU architectures. But the Edison appears to be the somewhat easier target given that Firedrake is x86 already and has support for SMP. If only I could figure out how to flash my own kernel onto the Edison, the documentation doesn't make that quite clear and I don't really want to brick it after only having it for a couple of hours...

Oh well, it wouldn't be fun if it was too easy!
