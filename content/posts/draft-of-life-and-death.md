On July 8th 2016 at 2:08pm, my mom passed away in her hospice bed. Her death certificate says she died at 2:34pm, which is when she was legally declared dead by the hospice doctor. In the 24 minutes difference, my family and I sat in the hospice garden just outside of my mom's room and let reality sink in. We all had just watched her pass away at age 56, after a 2 year long battle with cancer and even though in the end we all secretly and somewhat openly hoped she would pass away quickly and without further suffering, no one actually wanted her to die.

She was a further 30-some hours in that same room, time given to us by the hospice. Friends, who had only visited her the days before when she was accepted into the hospice, visited her one last time to say goodbye. And then, the morticians came said what every single person before them had said ("so sorry for your loss"), put her in a coffin and that was that. I stole a roll of the hospice's toilet paper that day due to a lack of tissues and an abundance of tears.

The winter before my mom and I got into a bit of a fight and I hadn't spoken to her for a good while. I had just moved to Brighton (that's in England) in October of 2015 and it was about a misunderstanding of a visit my fianc√©e and I were planning. Long story short, we didn't visit her despite being in Germany around Christmas time. I would see, and talk, to her again in April 2016 when I went to Germany to pick a few of my things up. In total, I maybe saw her for 3 hours.
